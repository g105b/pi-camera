Raspberry Pi IP camera recorder

The purpose of this repository is to provide a single codebase for automated IP camera recording on a Raspberry Pi device (or similar).

Clone this repository to the SD card of the Pi, run `install.sh`, then leave the Pi. Install will set up the mounting of hard drives, connection to IP cameras, etc. where appropriate.
